Program written in python for calculating the entropy of file
The given problem statement was as follows

Exercise 1.6. Write a program to do the following: given an input text file , compute the empirical
pmf/histogram of the characters in the file (i,e., the fraction of ‘a’, ‘b’, etc.). The program should print the
empirical pmf as a 26-length vector corresponding to letters in the English alphabet.

The empirical pmf of a sequence is also called the type of the sequence.
